# void-live-audio

Script for enabling and configuring audio for live environments.
Intended to help vision-impaired users set up audio so that the espeakup screenreader uses the right soundcard and is audible.

Adapted from [archiso](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/archiso/)'s livecd-sound script
and the associated [livecd-sounds](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/livecd-sounds/).
